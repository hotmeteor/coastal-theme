Coastal
=============

### Coastal is a minimal, responsive theme for LemonStand.

While you can definitely use Coastal as-is, Coastal is meant to be modified. The HTML is lean, and the theme is built on the [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) framework (v3.2.0), making it easy to change as desired. Also, an optional `custom.css` is referenced in the theme to make adding overriding styles even easier.



#### TODO
- Add plugin for nicer dropdowns (ie. Chosen)
- Make it easier to add custom category images, per category
