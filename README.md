Coastal
=============

### [Coastal](https://coastal.lemonstand.com/) is a minimal, responsive theme for [LemonStand](https://lemonstand.com/).

While you can definitely use Coastal as-is, Coastal is meant to be modified. The HTML is lean, and the theme is built on the [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) framework (v3.2.0), making it easy to change as desired. Also, an optional `custom.css` is referenced in the theme to make adding overriding styles even easier.


#### Quick Install

1. Download this theme as a [zip file](https://github.com/hotmeteor/coastal-theme/archive/master.zip)
2. Follow the instructions for [importing a theme](http://docs.lemonstand.com/article/69-how-to-import-a-theme)
